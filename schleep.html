							<h2>UX/UI Design / Research / Wirefrmaing / Prototyping </h2>
							<h1>Background</h1>
								<p>I started this project as a response to one of the problems that I have noticed my friends and family suffer from : poor sleep quality. Sleep is very important for an individual's daily life; it is what allows them to function throughout the day and has been shown to improve cognitive functions and memory. I wanted to examine different ways people would be able to take initiative of their own sleep, and turn it into a more personalized experience for users. Through research, I discovered that the overarching problem was the lack of good sleep habits that were formed due to lifestyle and environmental factors.</p>
								<h3>Goals</h3>
									<p>Creating an end-to-end mobile application that allows users to set personal sleep schedules, improve their sleep habits, and inform them of the benefits of sleep, thus minimizing poor sleep quality.</p>
								<h3>Problem </h3>
									<p>As a university student, I;ve noticed that many of my friends have problems sleeping, whether it is problems falling asleep or problems staying asleep. And these problems are can be caused by a variety of factors, such as stress, insomnia, or the physical environment. Even as you sleep, studies have shown that there can be multiple factors disrupting your sleep, such as exposure to blue light during the nighttime, circadian rhythm, sleep posture, and more. These factors can be hard to control; the best that we can do is try to have the best sleep quality we can despite these challenges. </p>
								<h3>My Impact</h3>
									<p>For this project, I validated the need for the original product I had in mind and leveraged data from research to create a mobile application product as a solo designer.</p>
							<h1>Research</h1>
								<h3>Goals</h3>
									<p>Below are the areas I'd like to explore during the user research<br>
									I want to understand : </p>
										<li>The patterns behind formation of sleep habits</li>
										<li>What are the user's motivations to setting sleep schedules</li>
										<li>What user's want out of improving their sleep schedule</li>
								<h3>Methodologies</h3>
									<p>Secondary research on top products related to sleeping to determine the gap in the market. In-depth user interviews with 10 students or working professionals who would like to improve their sleep quality.</p>
								<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
									<p>For part of this project, I decided to explore top rated and popular apps for improving sleep to compare key features and see what problems they address. I discovered that the sleep applications address different things; some address meditation, some adress sleep schedules, and some address waking up in the morning</p>
									<p>Many apps do not offer that much free content aimed at helping users improve their sleep schedule during the research phase. As I'd like to set my users for the long-time success, I realized that this can be achieved by designing a product that addresses the problems that occur when trying to fall asleep. Synthesized data from the user interviews only confirmed that assumption.</p>
								<h3>User Interviews</h3>
								<h3>Research Synopsis</h3>
							<h1>Define</h1>
								<h3>User Persona</h3>
								<p>After I compiled the outtakes from the research into the affinity map, I was able to create a persona that represents the main user group.</p>
								<h3>Use Scenario</h3>
									<p>After creating my persona, I decided to place her in a specific situation when she can use the product. The primary use case was inspired by synthesized research from the user interviews, competitive analysis showing the niche in the market, and a persona I could fully emphatize with.</p>
									<p>The mobile application allows her to set her sleep schedule according to her daily habits and sets up the user for long-time success by using interactive methods to keep the user accountable to their goals, thus improving sleep habits/</p>
