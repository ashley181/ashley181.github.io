							<h2>UX/UI Design / Research / Wirefrmaing / Prototyping </h2>
							<h1>Background</h1>
								<p>Peas the Mind is a project developed for the Hack the North 2023 hackathon in Waterloo Ontario. Peas of Mind is an web application that allows users to leave reviews of different fruits, vegetables, and seafood weekly so that other users will be able to find local grocery stores that have the freshest groceries based on the recommendations given.
								</p>
								<h3>Goals</h3>
									<p>Creating an end-to-end mobile application that allows users leave reviews on grocery stores based on their products and allows users to find grocery stores that sell the freshest products based on the recommendations. We observed popular grocery-shopping habits and tried to incorporate features into our app. Our seasonal feature allows users to shop fresh seasonal products, while our Map feature highlight popular vendors in walkable radius to a userâ€™s current location. The search bar allows users to search the product to find which store(s) have the freshest product. </p>
								<h3>Problem </h3>
									<p>As students we noticed that most people typically shop at large supermarket chains, that import foods full of preservatives from faraway distribution centres so the food is typically less fresh and healthy while local farms typically have fresher products We wanted to build an app like "Yelp" and "Rotton Tomatoes" to incorporate user reviews that can influence purchasing behaviour to encourage healthy grocery choices and support local grocers and farmers. Large supermarket chains also drive a lot of traffic and business away from smaller local businesses, so we wanted to create an app that would drive more traffic and bring awareness to the smaller local businesses.</p>
								<h3>My Impact</h3>
									<p>We wanted to address the problem of difficulty of finding the freshest groceries from local grocery stores, which we acknowledge can be hard to do. We wanted to focus on three things; health and wellness, community engagement, and economic impact. </p>
								<h3>Feedback</h3>
									<p>This project was designed to solve a problem that exists in our current economy but can be hard to find a solution. When presenting this project to the judges on a hackathon, they acknowledge that our product does a good job at addressing the problem. However there could be a better solution - instead of leaving user-based recommendations for grocery stores, it would be more beneficial to add an e-commerce solution that would also deliver the freshest groceries to a user's doorstep instead of users having to go out and get them. We will consider this feedback as direction for our next steps.</p>						
							<h1>Research</h1>
								<h3>Goals</h3>
									<p>Below are the areas I'd like to explore during the user research<br>
									I want to understand : </p>
										<li>The patterns behind people's grocery shopping habits</li>
										<li>What are the user's motivations to choosing where they shop</li>
										<li>What user's want out of shopping from more local grocery markets</li>
								<h3>Methodologies</h3>
									<p>Secondary research on top products related to user reviews and user-based recommendations to create an app that was suitable for the solution for the problem because we noticed that there were not that many apps that addressed the same problem. In-depth user interviews with 10 students or working professionals who would like to improve their shopping habits.</p>
								<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
									<p>For part of this project, I decided to explore top rated and popular apps for users to leave reviews and make decisions based on other user recommednations, and obersve which features allowed to make the app successful to be incorporated inro our product.</p>
									<p>As this was a 36 hour hackathon, from start to finish, we didn't have time to do some aspects of user experience, such as competitive audits, affinity maps, and user interviews. We focused on ideation, wireframing, prototyping, user flows, and user personas</p>
								<h3>User Interviews</h3>
								<h3>Research Synopsis</h3>
							<h1>Define</h1>
								<h3>User Persona</h3>
								<p>I was able to create a persona that represents the main user group : People who leave reviews and people who use the reviews to choose which store(s) to shop at</p>
								<h3>Use Scenario</h3>
									<p>After creating my persona, I decided to place him in a specific situation where he can use the product. The primary use case was inspired by synthesized research from the user interviews, competitive analysis showing the niche in the market, and a persona I could fully emphatize with.</p>
									<p>The web application allows Chris to choose which grocery store to shop at to by the freshest groceries based on the reviews for a certain product</p>
									<p>The web application allows Jasper to leave recommendation for local grocery stores that have the freshest groceries that he likes</p>
							<h1>Ideation</h1>
								<h3>Initial Task Flows</h3>
									<p>After having defined the features of the app, I created flows for the main tasks</p>
									<p>User Flow : Launch the app to see if you are able to set a time to sleep and wake up by</p>
									<p>This user flow assumes the user is using the app for the first time</p>
									<p>Task : Take a picture to share it with your friends</p>
									<p>Learn more about sleep posture</p>
								<h3>App Navigation</h3>
									<p>Based on the user flow, task flows, and feature roadmap, I designed the simple app map that is functional and easy to navigate</p>
								<h3>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h3>
									<p>The first version of the lo-fi wireframes allowed me to run early usability tests and discover the priority revisions that need to be implemented ASAP. This decreased the number of iterations to the later versions with all effort being put into creating the hi-fi interface. The version below inccludes iterations made mainly to the information architecture such as :</p>
										<li>Implemented a social and photosharing aspect to the app</li>
										<li>Added a Home Screen for the Landing Page to improve user flow</li>
								<h3>UI Kit</h3>
									<p>I created the UI kit that reflects the Schleep brand adjectives. As the name of the app is Schleep, it helps users fall asleep with the visual use of sleep.</p>
							<h1>Prototype and Test</h1>
								<h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
								<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
									<p>I tested the first version of the prototype with 5 hypothetical users to determine the necessary revisions to make the overall experience more intuitive and pleasant.</p>
									<p>Main pain points that were discovered during the tests and addressed in the iteration:</p>
										<li>Users had problems setting their own times using the touch feature
											<br>
											Fix : add a feature where it allows users to input the desired time
										</li>
										<li>Users may have issues navigating other parts of the app from one given screen
											<br>
											Fix : Add a universal navigation bar to each screen
										</li>
										<li> Users didn't like their camera and other buttons built into their phone disrupting their use of the app
											<br>
											Fix : Added a universal header that accounts for the existance of buttons and other features that are part of their phone architecture
										</li>
							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
								<p>While working on this project I learned to really trust the research and discovery process as I started working on it with a very different assumption and initial idea on how I wanted to approach the problem. In the end, I learned about different possibilities and solutions to satisfy user needs and how to integrate those possible solutions into the app. I also learnt that it is alright to take a step back and restart the process if you are not satisfied with where its going, whether it is a visual aspect or information architecture. I also learned that it is important to ask for another set of eyes for the product; eventually there will be times where I would get burnt out and frusterated that I couldn't figure something out, but when I asked others who had no knowledge of the project to look it over for it, they would provide me suggestions on what I can improve, which I really appreciated.</p>
