							<h1>UBC Course Website</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>UX/UI Design / Wireframing / Prototyping / Front-end Development</h2>
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>I worked on this project with a professor at UBC, as part of my job as a learning technology rover. Being a student and working in educational technology, I wanted to help find an innovative way to make learning course material easier and effective for students. The project was first presented to me as a rough wireframe on Google Sites with little thought for best practices of user experience. </p>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<p>Creating a educational website to be integrated within course materials on Canvas, to make student experience and learning a seamless experience.
								<br> 
								I anticipate that there are many users that will use the website, so another goal of mine was to keep the website as accessible as it can be, by considering factors such as image size, text size, and colours, as well as keeping it a responsive website so it can be used on multiple platforms.
							</p>
							<h3>Problem</h3>
							<p>Learning can be a challenge for students more many different reasons, such as inability to focus, procrastination, sleep deprivation, disinterest in topic of material, and more. I acknowledge that there is no one solution that will tackle every student's reason for not being able to study; the reality is that it is extremely difficult to create something that will help every student study, as every student is different and have individual learning styles. However, we can try to support learning in any way we can, such as holding office hours to address student's questions about material, having various modes of learning to support different learning styles and having groups in classes to support student interaction. </p>
							<h3>My Impact</h3>
							<p>For this project, I was responsible of evaluating the rough wireframe that was presented to me and create a product that would best suit students needs while keeping the original structure of the website as a solo designer.</p>
							<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
							<p>However, as this contains the intellectual process of the professor whom I had worked with, I will not be able to display any work that contains the intellectual property; instead, all the work will be populated with Lorem Ipsum text and will show my thought process when designing this website.</p>
							<h1>User Interviews</h1>
							<h3>Research Synopsis</h3>
							<p>After conducting user interviews, I was unsuprised that many students had experiences and observations that mirrored mine as a student when trying to learn course materials. One of the most effective ways of learning was to increase user retention on the material, which proves to be an important factor as students get distracted for many reasons. One of the biggest wishes was that the information is presented in a concise manner, and for different modules, the material layout remained consistent all throughout the modules. What was suprising to me was the desire for real-world applications and examples of how the information is applied; that was something that I have not yet considered as a student, as I always took the information at face value. </p>
							<p>User insights as well as feedback from my colleagues and fellow peers gave me confidence in the direction I needed to go with this project and define important needs that can be addressed within the product.</p>
							<h1>User Persona</h1>
							<p> After I compiled the outtakes from the research in an affinity map, I was able to create a persona that represents the main user group</p>
							<h3>Use Scenario</h3>
							<p>After creating my persona, I decided to place her in a specific situation in where she can use this website. The primary use case was inspired by synthesized research from the user interviews and a persona I could fully emphatize with as a student. This website is designed to supplement and support student learning, integrated as part of their main learning management system, thus reinforcing the information that students learn during lectures and other materials.</p>
							<h3>User Story</h3>
							<p>"As a fourth-year undergraduate student, I want to be able to find ways that will improve my studying and retention of information so that I can do well in exams and the course"</p>
							<h1>Ideation</h1>
							<p>After realizing what kind of features will be the most useful for students, I decided to brainstorm different ways of presenting information in the website. I want the website to be easy to use and navigate when learning about the material, regardless if they have learnt the material before or not. To do so requires a simple interface, with all the details of each module being consistent with each other.</p>
							<h3>Initial Task Flows</h3>
							<p>After having defined the features of the app, I created user flows for the main tasks.</p>
							<img src="images/mmeuf.png" alt="" />
							<p>User Flow : Launch the app to see if students are successfully able to navigate the website to learn more about their topic of choice. 
								<br> 
								Assume that the user is using the website for the first time.
							</p>
							<img src="images/mmetree.png" alt="" />
							<p>Task : Navigate to Module 3 and find a suggested reading to read</p>
							<h3>App Navigation</h3>
							<h3>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h3>
							<img src="images/mme1.png" alt="" />
							<img src="images/mme2.png" alt="" />
							<p>The first version of lo-fi wireframes allowed me to run early usability tests and discover the priority revisions that need to be implemented ASAP after discussing with colleagues on this project. That decreased the number of iterations to the later versions with all effort being put into creating the hi-fi interface. The version below includes iterations made mainly to the information architecture such as:</p>
								<li>Renmoved individual headings for every module and replaced it with universal headings to keep it consistent</li>
								<li>Moved the Work Cited section into its respective pages</li>
								<li>Instead of having information overlay images on the landing page, moved the information under their respective images</li>
							<br>
							<h3>UI Kit</h3>
							<p>The following is the UI kit that reflects the UBC brand identity, including colours, logos, fonts, and font sizes, and can be found on this link : https://brand.ubc.ca/guidelines/. As this is a website for a UBC Course, the guidelines were followed to ensure that the branding across all UBC-affliated products are consistent with each other</p>

							<h1>Prototype and Test</h1>
							<h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
							<p>Go here to see the full hi-fi prototype</p>
							<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
							<p>I tested the first version of the high fidelity prototype with 5 users to determine the necessary revisions to make the overall experience more intuitive and pleasant. Users consisted of those with prior user testing experience, such as senior colleagues, supervisors, colleagues, and those who work in the development team.</p>
							<p>Main pain points that were discovered during the tests and addressed in the iteration</p>
								<li>Users had a problem navigating to other modules within an indivudal modules
									<br>
									Fix : replace the heading within each indivudal module (prior : Home, Resources, Suggested Reading, etc) with headings that allows users to navigate through the entire site (Sketches, Mapping, Storytelling, Digital)
								</li>
								<li> Image to Text ratio was off; Images were too big causing text column to be too narrow and would read awkwardly
									<br>
									Fix : Adjusted Image to Text ratio so text column passage would read better
								</li>
								<li> Images differentiating Modules on Landing Page had overlay text when a mouse was hovered made the image too crowded
									<br>
									Fix : Moved the text for each image from over the image to under its respective image
								</li>
							<br>
							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
							<p>Not only has working with the professor and my colleagues on this project taught me more about student learning and educational technology practices from an educator viewpoint, it also taught me more about learning as a student which is valuable. There were many small details that I had overlooked as a student studying course content, that when working on this project, it made me realize how important the small details were to increasing the quality of learning. I learned that as redundant it is to make everything important, consistency is crucial for good user flow and experience. It allows users to understand the website better, causing less confusion when using and navigating the site, as well as increasing site efficiency. This website was created with efficiency in mind, and working on this project helped teach me all the small details to look for when designing the website. There are many students who are anticpated to use the website so it was important to make the project as accerssible as possible to help support learning for ALL students. From an individual persective, it is very easy to assume that whatever is good/bad for you is good/bad for everyone. However this is not the case; it may not account for those who are visually impaired or those who are forced to use smaller screens or have unreliable access to internet, which is why it is important to keep the website as accessible as it can be for everyone to ensure fair and effective learning strate4gies</p>
