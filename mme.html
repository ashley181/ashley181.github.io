							<h2>UX/UI Design / Wireframing / Prototyping / Front-end Development</h2>
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>I worked on this project with a professor at UBC, as part of my job as a learning technology rover. Being a student and working in educational technology, I wanted to help find an innovative way to make learning course material easier and effective for students. The project was first presented to me as a rough wireframe on Google Sites with little thought for best practices of user experience. </p>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<p>Creating a educational website to be integrated within course materials on Canvas, to make student experience and learning a seamless experience.</p>
							<h3>Problem</h3>
							<p>Learning can be a challenge for students more many different reasons, such as inability to focus, procrastination, sleep deprivation, disinterest in topic of material, and more. I acknowledge that there is no one solution that will tackle every student's reason for not being able to study; the reality is that it is extremely difficult to create something that will help every student study, as every student is different and have individual learning styles. However, we can try to support learning in any way we can, such as holding office hours to address student's questions about material, having various modes of learning to support different learning styles and having groups in classes to support student interaction. </p>
							<h3>My Impact</h3>
							<p>For this project, I was responsible of evaluating the rough wireframe that was presented to me and create a product that would best suit students needs while keeping the original structure of the website as a solo designer.</p>
							<h1>User Interviews</h1>
							<h3>Research Synopsis</h3>
							<p>After conducting user interviews, I was unsuprised that many students had experiences and observations that mirrored mine as a student when trying to learn course materials. One of the most effective ways of learning was to increase user retention on the material, which proves to be an important factor as students get distracted for many reasons. One of the biggest wishes was that the information is presented in a concise manner, and for different modules, the material layout remained consistent all throughout the modules. What was suprising to me was the desire for real-world applications and examples of how the information is applied; that was something that I have not yet considered as a student, as I always took the information at face value. </p>
							<p>User insights as well as feedback from my colleagues and fellow peers gave me confidence in the direction I needed to go with this project and define important needs that can be addressed within the product.</p>
							<h1>User Persona</h1>
							<p> After I compiled the outtakes from the research in an affinity map, I was able to create a persona that represents the main user group</p>
							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
							<p>Not only has working with the professor and my colleagues on this project taught me more about student learning and educational technology practices from an educator viewpoint, it also taught me more about learning as a student.</p>
